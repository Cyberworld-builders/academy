### Scan my LAN

I'm in an Ubuntu shell running on WSL. I need to reverse shell and root a machine on the LAN of my host machine. To do this I need to:
1. Get my IP address
2. Find the IP of my host machine.
3. Scan the LAN of my host machine for other hosts.
4. Iterate over the hosts on the LAN and identify my target by name.
5. SSH into the machine because I know the password. It's not really a hack. I know it started off sounding hacky but it's actually my machine. I legally own it.
6. If it gives you any trouble, then we may legit practice hacking it.

#### Get My IP
```bash
ifconfig
```

#### Result
```
inet 172.24.77.63  netmask 255.255.240.0  broadcast 172.24.79.255
```

#### Scan My LAN to find my host IP
```bash
nmap -sn 172.24.64.0/20
```

#### Result
```
