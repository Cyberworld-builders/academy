## Hackthebox VPN

- From the console, click "CONNECT TO HTB"
- Download the VPN config
- From the terminal, make sure `openvpn` is installed.

### Install openvpn on WSL/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

- Copy the ovpn config file from downloads to the WSL/Ubuntu filesystem.
> NOTE: The above step is technically not necessary I just like to treat my WSL environment as much like it's own machine as I can get away with.
- 

```bash
openvpn lab_cheshirewight.ovpn
```

```
Options error: Unrecognized option or missing or extra parameter(s) in lab_cheshirewight.ovpn:12: data-ciphers-fallback (2.4.12)

### Remove Heroku. I don't even need it.

sudo apt-get remove heroku
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/heroku.list
sudo apt-get update
```

### Upgrade Openvpn
```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade openvpn
```
