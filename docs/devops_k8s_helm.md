# Learning Helm Charts

## Example
Demonstrate walking through a basic helm chart usage.

This is probably a good example:

[Youtube Video - _How to create Helm Charts - The Ultimate Guide_](https://youtu.be/jUYNS90nq8U?si=PgWttWPonRH-ZPeg)

[Github Repo - `devopsjourney1/helm-webapp`](https://github.com/devopsjourney1/helm-webapp)

## Notes
- Found a good, quick, simple, straightforward walkthrough off of Youtube that has a companion repo on Github. 
- Started this markdown doc in `docs/devops_k8s_helm.md` to log my progress.
- Created a folder in `devops-k8s-helm-test1/` to store my work. The folder name follows the same convention as the doc. This convention keeps the folder structure clean and simple while mapping out how a more complex structure might look in the future as things grow in complexity and the amount of content increases.
- Cloned the repo so I can conveniently scan and search the example code with my IDE as well as make it conversational with an LLM.
- generated scaffolding with `helm create webapp1`
- analyzed the scaffolding
