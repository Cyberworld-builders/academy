Certainly, here’s the transcript with a new line after every sentence or every 20 words, whichever comes first:

the tour browser is one of the most common ways that you or anyone else could access the dark web it’s a web browser that allows you to visit these onion addresses or websites hosted across tour hidden Services it routes your traffic through all these nodes and you have to know the exact URL or location as to where you want to go and how to get there and it is the dark web after all there’s a lot of weird stuff available out and about for sale whether it’s malware hey information database dumps passwords credentials that are leaked put out into the public and drugs ilicit illegal stuff that shouldn’t be out and about

I’m looking at one of those dark web marketplaces now and hey you can see all the sketchy stuff that they might offer now let me say a lot of this may very well be a scam not real totally illegitimate and just garbage and trash but this stuff is out there even just taking a look at everything that they post my goodness it’s pretty wild now

I’m more interested in the cyber security implications I’m wondering about those adversaries the threat actors the bad people and attackers that might be selling malware ransomware info Stealers or whatever and knowing what they’re up to so I like to look around the dark web and use the tour browser for research but I got to thinking hey are there any sort of breadcrumbs or fingerprints Left Behind from even using that software and perusing snooping around so in this video I’d like to dig into that are there any forensic artifacts from the tour browser but before we dive in I want to give you a little bit more background context

I love to use flare to do some of that dark web dumpster diving and just seeing what is out there because it gives me an exposure profile letting me know even myself individually or my company or my business what risks are up against me for a lot of that public exposed information stuff that might be in a ransomware leak site or sold on a Marketplace could be anything

I could set up different identifiers for things that I want to track like a business or just threats and cyber crime that I’m interested and want to stay on top of you could even generate reports send them to slack send them to jira send them to email whatever I don’t want to beat you over the head with this process here but I think it’s pretty cool hey we can create an identifier for a website domain anyone’s name email IP address whatever and you could set different severity filters or create any alerts that we might like to bring it to email or slack or anything else with any identifier that’s set up you could filter and narrow it down into different categories or where flare might try to search for track and find that information whether it’s on the open Internet on the clear net or the dark web those Shady kind of questionable illicit places where information might be exposed like those ransomware leak sites hey stolen breach credentials data dumps that are available marketplaces telegram chats whatever and flare is pulling this information from a ton of different collection points it’s wild you can find so much stuff

they also do a lot of really incredible stuff in correlating all this data one of their new features threat flow over in beta on the navigation here they pull together a whole lot of this information and then add it with context of what’s happening in the real world like what these thread actors what these cyber criminals are up to and then seeing that across the cyber security landscape I think it’s pretty slick but anyway using this for research is really cool because we basically have a giant Google search across like all of those etchy places in the dark web and I could just search for anything I wanted to whether it’s ransomware or info stealer malware or leak
